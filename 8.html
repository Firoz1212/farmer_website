               </h4>
               <img src="image2/8.1.png" alt="" srcset="">
       <h5> Features</h5>
       <p>It is an engine operated, walk behind type harvester suitable for harvesting and windrowing cereals and oilseed crops. The reaper consists of engine, power transmission box, pneumatic wheels, cutter bar, crop row dividers, conveyor belts with lugs, star wheels, operating controls and a sturdy frame. The engine power is transmitted to cutter bar and conveyor belts through belt pulleys. During forward motion of the reaper, crop row dividers divide the crop, which come in contact with cutter bar, where shearing of crop stems takes place. The cut crop is conveyed to one side of the machine by the conveyor belt fitted with lugs and is windrowed in the field. The crop is bundled manually and transported to threshing yard. There are no shattering losses due to vertical conveying of the crop</p>

          <img src="image2/8.2.png" alt="" srcset="">
          <h5> Features</h5>
          <p>The machine consists of a 76 mm pitch reciprocating cutter bar assembly, seven crop row dividers, and two vertical conveyor belts fitted with lugs, pressure springs, pulleys and gearbox for the power transmission system. The crop row dividers are fitted in front of the cutter bar assembly and the star wheels are mounted over the crop row dividers. The machine is mounted in front of the tractor and the power to the machine is given from tractor PTO with the help of intermediate shaft running beneath the chassis of the tractor and a coupling shaft. Height of the machine above ground is controlled by tractor hydraulics with the help of pulleys and steel ropes.  After the crop is cut by the cutter bar, it is held in a vertical position and crop is delivered to one side of the machine by lugged belt conveyors and fall on the ground in the form of a windrow perpendicular to the direction of movement of the machine.

<h4> 8.7   STRAW REAPER/ STRAW COMBINE
</h4>
<img src="image2/8.7.png" alt="" srcset="">

<h5> Features</h5>
<p> Straw combine operated by tractor PTO has cutter bar reel, feeding auger and bruising cylinder like a traditional thresher. Straw thrown and stubble left by the grain combine is collected by straw combine and delivered to the cylinder concave section, where it is cut into pieces and passed through the concave. A reciprocating cutter bar is used for reaping the standing stubbles and the portion of the straw left uncut by the combine harvester. Straw, which passes through the concave, is aspirated by a blower and fed into a trolley on rear side covered by a wire net. For recovering the left grains from the straw, a sieve system is provided below the concave</p>

<h4>8.8 POTATO  DIGGER  ELEVATOR
</h4>
<img src="image2/8.8.png" alt="" srcset="">

<h5> Features</h5>
<p>  The tractor PTO operated potato digger elevator consists of a crescent/convex triangular shape-cutting blade, elevator rollers generally made of iron bars, power transmission device and a tractor hitching system.  The crescent shape blade helps in digging of potatoes, which are carried to the shaking conveyor belt and are finally dropped at the rear of the machine in windrow form. These are then collected manually. The shaking of belt helps in removal of the soil from the potatoes. These machines can also be used for harvesting onions. In some models, discs are provide in the front to cut haulm or for guiding the blade along the rows. </p>
