       <h5> Features</h5>
       <p>It is a tractor-operated implement and consists of share point, share, mould board, landslide, frog, shank, frame and hitch system. The share point is of bar type and is made from high carbon steel or low alloy steel. The share is also made from high carbon steel or low alloy steel. Both are hardened and tempered to suitable hardness (about 45 HRC).
            The working of the plough is controlled by hydraulic system and three-point linkage. Its bar-point makes it suitable to break hardpan of the soil.

          <h5> Features</h5>
          <p>The plough consists of common mainframe, disc beam assemblies, rockshaft assembly and a heavy spring loaded furrow wheel and a gauge wheel. In some models Disc Plough is designed to operate as 2, 3 or 4 bottoms, by adding or removing the sub beam assemblies according to requirement. The disc angle ranges from 40º to 45º to obtain the desired width of cut and the tilt angle ranges from 15º to 25º for penetration. The discs of the plough are made of high carbon steel or alloy steel and the edges are hardened and sharpened. The discs are mounted on tapered roller bearings. Scrapers provided prevent soil build up on the discs in sticky soils. 
              The furrow slice rides along the curvature and is pulverized to some extent before being thrown.</p>

<h4>4.4  DISC HARROW
</h4>
<img src="image2/4.4.png" alt="" srcset="">

<h5> Features</h5>
<p> It consists of sturdy frame and gangs of discs each mounted on a common shaft and can be classified 
  into single and double action (tandem). In tandem disc harrow, the discs on the front gang throw soil 
  outward and the rear gang inward. Therefore, no soil remains uncut by the offset disc harrow. Discs are
   made from high carbon steel or alloy steel; the cutting edges are hardened and tempered to suitable 
   hardness. The gangs can be moved in either direction on the hitch frame. The rear gang can be moved the 
   same amount as the front gang. When operating in orchards or plantations, the harrow can be offset to the right or left, thus enabling soil to be thrown towards or away from the trees. The offset-feature makes it possible to work under low–hanging branches of trees. Discs with notches on the outer rim are also available for operation in weed-infested fields. Three point hydraulic linkage and hydraulic control makes it highly maneuverable. 
  It is available as trailed type version.</p>

<h5> Features</h5>
<p> The power tiller is powered with an 8-15 hp diesel engine. The engine power is transmitted to
   ground wheels through V –belt pulley. A tail wheel is provided at the rear to maintain the 
   operating depth. The rotary weeding attachment does weeding. The rotary weeder consists of three rows of discs mounted with 6 numbers of curved blades in opposite directions alternatively on each disc. These blades help in cutting and mulching the soil. The width of coverage of the rotary tiller is 500 mm and the depth of 
  operation can be adjusted to weed and mulch the soil in the cropped field.</p>
